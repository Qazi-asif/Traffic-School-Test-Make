// BACKUP OF ORIGINAL WEB.PHP - Created during state separation
// This file contains the original routes before state separation implementation
// Keep this file as reference for existing functionality

// Original routes backed up on: <?= date('Y-m-d H:i:s') ?>

// Note: This is a backup file. The actual routing is now handled by:
// - routes/web.php (main routing with state separation)
// - routes/florida.php (Florida-specific routes)
// - routes/missouri.php (Missouri-specific routes)  
// - routes/texas.php (Texas-specific routes)
// - routes/delaware.php (Delaware-specific routes)
// - routes/admin.php (Admin routes for all states)
