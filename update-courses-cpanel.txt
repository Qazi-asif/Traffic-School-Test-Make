=== Instructions for Updating Courses on cPanel ===

1. Upload the updated seeder files to your cPanel server:
   - database/seeders/Delaware3HourRefresherSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/DelawareAggressiveDrivingSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/Delaware6HourDefensiveDrivingSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/FloridaBDICourseSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/FloridaDefensiveDrivingSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/MissouriCourseContentSeeder.php
   - database/seeders/TexasDefensiveDrivingCompleteSeeder.php
   - app/Console/Commands/UpdateCoursePrices.php

2. SSH into your cPanel server or use Terminal in cPanel

3. Navigate to your Laravel project directory:
   cd /path/to/your/laravel/project

4. Run the update command:
   php artisan courses:update-prices

This command will:
✓ Update all existing course names and prices
✓ Create missing Texas Insurance Discount course ($28.00)
✓ Create missing Missouri Insurance Discount course ($24.95)
✓ Keep all your existing data (users, enrollments, payments, certificates)
